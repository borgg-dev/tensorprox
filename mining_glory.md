The system is designed with modularity in mind, allowing improvements in one area without requiring changes to others.

## XDP Program Improvements

The XDP program (`moat_xdp_core.c`) is the foundation of the protection system, operating at the kernel level for maximum performance. Consider these improvement vectors:

### Packet Classification Enhancements

Implementation example:
```c
// Enhanced flow key with protocol-specific fields
struct flow_key {
    __u32 src_ip;
    __u32 dst_ip;
    __u16 src_port;
    __u16 dst_port;
    __u8 protocol;
    
    // Protocol-specific tracking
    union {
        struct {
            __u32 seq_num;   // TCP sequence number
            __u8 flags;      // TCP flags from last packet
        } tcp;
        struct {
            __u16 query_id;  // DNS query ID
            __u8 opcode;     // DNS operation code
        } dns;
    } proto_data;
};
```

### Acceleration and Offloading

    __u32 rate;             // Tokens per second
    __u32 burst;            // Maximum burst size
};

struct {
    __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_LRU_HASH);
    __uint(key_size, sizeof(struct flow_key));

    for packet_data, protocol in packet_batch:
        # Extract packet details...
        src_ips.add(src_ip)
        dst_ports.add(dst_port)
        packet_sizes.append(packet_size)
    
    # Calculate entropy
    src_ip_entropy = calculate_entropy(src_ips)
    dst_port_entropy = calculate_entropy(dst_ports)

        initial_rate = 50  # 50 pps
        
        # Apply initial rate limit
        result = self._apply_rate_limit(attack_info, initial_rate)
        
        # Schedule progressive reduction
        self._schedule_rate_adjustment(attack_info, initial_rate)
        
        return result
        
    def _schedule_rate_adjustment(self, attack_info, initial_rate):
        # Schedule rate adjustments at intervals
        intervals = [30, 60, 120, 300]  # seconds
        rate_reductions = [0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05]  # multipliers
        
        for i, interval in enumerate(intervals):
