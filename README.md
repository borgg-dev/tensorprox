This repository is the **official codebase for Bittensor Subnet 234 (SN234) v0.1.0+.**. To learn more about the Bittensor project and the underlying mechanics, [read here.](https://docs.bittensor.com/).

# Introduction

This repository defines an incentive mechanism for creating a distributed Scrubber Center to protect miners and server instances from DDoS attacks.
The validation process employs **synthetic traffic generated by alternating between normal traffic and complex DDoS attack simulations, aiming to reproduce the natural behavior of both normal and malicious traffic.**.

# Tensorprox

## Overview

Tensorprox is a distributed network for DDoS protection built on top of the Bittensor SDK. The project implements a novel approach to DDoS mitigation through a decentralized network of validators and miners.

## Architecture

### Network Components

Tensorprox consists of two primary node types:
- **Validators**: Responsible for challenging miners and evaluating their DDoS protection performance
- **Miners**: Provide DDoS protection services and compete based on their effectiveness

### Workflow

1. **Connection Establishment**
   - Miners provide SSH access to three critical machines:
     * Attacker Machine: Generates malicious traffic
     * Benign Machine: Generates normal traffic
     * King Machine: The target receiver machine

2. **Challenge Process**
   - Validators use the PingSynapse protocol (built with Bittensor SDK) to:
     * Request and receive SSH connection details
     * Lock miner's machine access to prevent cheating
     * Run DDoS protection challenges

3. **Challenge Execution**
   - Validators simulate various traffic scenarios:
     * DDoS attacks from Attacker Machine
     * Normal traffic from Benign Machine
     * Target traffic directed to King Machine

4. **Miner Evaluation**
   - Miners deploy their custom routing firewall system
   - Goal: Effectively forward or block traffic based on their DDoS protection model
   - Validators assess performance using specific metrics

## Key Technologies

- **Bittensor SDK**: Provides communication protocol between nodes
- **SSH Access Management**: Secure machine interaction
- **Custom Routing Firewall**: Miner-specific traffic filtering

## Planned Features

- Decentralized DDoS protection network
- Competitive performance-based rewards
